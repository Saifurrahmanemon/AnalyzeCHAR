## About The Project

I built(still in development mode) this web application to help people analyze images and extract all sorts information from them.During the development phase, I got more confidence in my ability to build web applications using Typscript, perform automated testing and working with Azure Computer Vision AI API.

In this project I have been exposed to many practical techniques that I wouldn't have learned otherwise. Examples as following but not limited to:

-  **Building React app using TypeScript**
-  **Writting Unit And Intergration Test**
-  **Working with FormData() and ImageBB Api**
-  **Professional Git workflow with pull requests**
-  **Code reviews**
-  **Continuous integration**
